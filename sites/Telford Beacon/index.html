            <h1>Telford Beacon</h1>
            <p>The original King William IV Dock entrance in Dundee was indicated by the Telford beacon.  
                James Leslie created the design, and it was founded in the middle of the 1830s(in 1834 AD).  
                Thomas Telford, the engineer who had advised Leslie, is credited with naming the lighthouse.
                It is a lighthouse that once guarded over the entry between King William IV Dock and the tidal harbour.
                This tiny beacon lighthouse once sat on the wharf between the tidal harbour and King William IV dock to help guide ships in past the various obstacles and hazards in the river. 
                The former harbour light remained in use until the King William IV dock was infilled in the 1960s, as part of the construction of the Tay Road Bridge, 
                specifically the roads connecting to the north end of the bridge.

                    <p>Telford Beacon was built around 1834 as part of a complex of four large docks in this area of Dundee along with related shipbuilding facilities. 
                        Thomas Telford began designing improvements for Dundee harbour in 1815. 
                        In 1825 he consulted with James Leslie on the construction of the King William Dock and its associated tidal harbour</p>

            <h1>Dundee Harbour</h1>
            <p>On the north coast of the Firth of Tay, immediately south of the city center, sits Dundee Harbour. 
                Since the Middle Ages, it has grown closely along with the city's fortunes. 
                This harbor increased in size and significance along with the growth of the whaling, jute, and flax trades, especially in the 19th century.

                The harbor complex formerly included shipbuilding yards, graving docks, the Victoria Dock and Camperdown Dock, the Earl Grey Dock, the King William IV Dock, and a harbor for the Tay ferry to Newport-on-Tay. 
                At its height, it covered about 48 hectares (119 acres) and provided quayside space extending 3.5 miles (5.6 km).
