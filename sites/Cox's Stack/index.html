        <h1>Cox's Stack</h1>
        <p>
            Cox's Stack was built in 1866 and is one of few remnants of Camperdown Works. 
            It is now a remnant of the once-thriving jute industry in Dundee.
            Its foundations were 13 ft deep and 35 ft square.
            The iconic Cox's Stack, a testament to Victorian craftsmanship, remained sturdy even after Camperdown Works closed in 1981.
            Camperdown Works was said to be the largest factory in the world at the time with over 5000 employees.
            A legal dispute revolved around the chimney when the Stack Leisure Park, named after the chimney, was rebuilt from the wreckage in 1993.

        <h1>Camperdown Works Facts</h1>
        <p>Located in Dundee, Scotland, Camperdown mill was a jute mill that formerly employed over 14,000 people, the most of whom were women.
             It encompassed over 30 acres. Owned by Cox Brothers, it was once the largest jute works in the world.
             The development of the Camperdown Works in Lochee commenced in 1849, and within a few years, 
             these works became the hub for all jute manufacturing activities.
             The power loom factory, the biggest structure ever constructed in the city of Dundee, was the first structure the Cox Brothers built on the property. 
             Built in 1853, a hand loom mill with 225 looms was located to the north of it.
             It had a 100-foot clock tower and was constructed in three phases starting in 1857.
             By 1878, the works produced its own machinery, had its own railway line, and employed 4,500 people, growing to 5,000 by 1900.
